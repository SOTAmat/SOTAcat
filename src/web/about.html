    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <div class="aboutParagraph">
    SOTACAT is a hardware module you can build that allows your mobile device to wirelessly control your transceiver using its “CAT” (Computer Aided Transceiver) port (also known as an “ACC” or “accessory” serial data port).
    </br></br>
    SOTACAT is currently designed to work with Elecraft KX2 and KX3 transceivers.
</br></br>
    The SOTAMĀT app on your mobile device knows how to communicate with SOTACAT to automate functions such as sending SOTA and POTA spots, alerts, or sending pre-defined messages (SMS/eMail).
</br></br>
The SOTACAT module controls the Elecraft radio so that it directly synthesizes SOTAMĀT's FT8 messages over-the-air without using audio (direct FSK synthesis, without using the microphone jack or the built-in microphone).
</br></br>
SOTAMĀT skimmers (automated monitoring stations) receive your transmission and decode the special SOTAMĀT FT8 messages.  The SOTAMĀT server then executes your command (spot, alert, message, etc.).
</br></br>
CW SOTA operators can use SOTACAT and SOTAMĀT’s “Alert-CW” mode to tickle the RBNhole service to automatically start spotting you as you QSY on CW.   That means you don’t have to remember to post a SOTA Alert before your trip: you can self-alert for RBNhole on the summit!
</br></br>
Before using SOTACAT, you should first learn how to use SOTAMĀT.  You must first create an online configuration before you can use SOTAMĀT.  Full instructions are found at: https://sotamat.com.
