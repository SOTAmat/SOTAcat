    <h2>About SOTACAT</h2>
    <p class="settings-info">
      SOTACAT is a hardware module that enables wireless control of your
      transceiver from your mobile device.
    </p>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        SOTACAT is a hardware module you can build that allows your mobile
        device to wirelessly control your transceiver using its "CAT" (Computer
        Aided Transceiver) port (also known as an "ACC" or "accessory" serial
        data port).
      </p>

      <p>
        SOTACAT is currently designed to work with Elecraft KX2 and KX3
        transceivers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SOTAMĀT app on your mobile device knows how to communicate with
        SOTACAT to automate functions such as sending SOTA and POTA spots,
        alerts, or sending pre-defined messages (SMS/eMail).
      </p>

      <p>
        The SOTACAT module controls the Elecraft radio so that it directly
        synthesizes SOTAMĀT's FT8 messages over-the-air without using audio
        (direct FSK synthesis, without using the microphone jack or the built-in
        microphone).
      </p>

      <p>
        SOTAMĀT skimmers (automated monitoring stations) receive your
        transmission and decode the special SOTAMĀT FT8 messages. The SOTAMĀT
        server then executes your command (spot, alert, message, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
        CW SOTA operators can use SOTACAT and SOTAMĀT's "Alert-CW" mode to
        tickle the RBNhole service to automatically start spotting you as you
        QSY on CW. That means you don't have to remember to post a SOTA Alert
        before your trip: you can self-alert for RBNhole on the summit!
      </p>

      <p>
        Before using SOTACAT, you should first learn how to use SOTAMĀT. You
        must first create an online configuration before you can use SOTAMĀT.

        <p>
          Provided key contributions to the implementation of direct FSK
          synthesis on the Elecraft KX radios, designed portions of the SOTACAT
          REST API, and implemented a similar testbed with his MAX-3B
          transceiver on which SOTAMAT control was first implemented.

        <h3>YL3JG, Karlis Goba</h3>
        <p>
          Developed the original 'ft8_lib' FT8 CODEC. A derivative version was
          later created for encoding use in SOTACAT, and ported to C# for
          encoding in SOTAMAT by AB6D.
