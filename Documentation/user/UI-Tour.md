## CHASE — Click-to-Pounce

Hunt activators from the spot list.

- Tap any spot → radio tunes automatically
- Filter by mode (CW, SSB, DATA) or type (SOTA, POTA, WWFF)
- Distance shown based on your saved location
- Opens WebSDR/KiwiSDR if tune targets configured

> **Note:** CHASE requires internet. When offline, this page will be empty.

## RUN — Operate

Control your radio during activation.

**Tune section:**
- VFO display with frequency/mode
- Band buttons (40m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m)
- Mode buttons (CW, SSB, DATA, AM, FM)
- Power and ATU controls

**Spot section:**
- SOTAmat button (FT8 self-spot, works offline with gateway coverage)
- SMS Spot / SMS QRT (requires cell service)

![Spot controls](../images/run-spot.png)

**Transmit section:**
- TX toggle
- CW keyer (3 message slots, 24 chars each)

![Transmit controls](../images/run-transmit.png)

**Tip:** After self-spotting, use split-screen mode with PoLo (or your preferred logging app) on top and SOTAcat's Transmit section on the bottom. This gives you one-tap access to TX, CW keyer messages, and your log — ideal for working a pileup right after spotting yourself.
