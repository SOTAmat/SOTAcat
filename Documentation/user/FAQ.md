## What's the default WiFi password?

The default password for the SOTAcat hotspot is `12345678`.

If your device has a different password (some hardware revisions), check the About page or device documentation.

## Does SOTAmat really work without cell service?

Yes, but with requirements:
- You need the SOTAmat app installed on your phone
- SOTAcat generates an FT8 signal that must be received by a gateway station
- The gateway reports your spot to the network

This works in areas with no cell service but where FT8 propagation reaches an RBN/PSKreporter gateway.

## Why doesn't .local work on my Android?

Android's mDNS support varies by device and OS version. Use `http://192.168.4.1` instead, or install [Bonjour Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.bonjourbrowser) to discover the address.
