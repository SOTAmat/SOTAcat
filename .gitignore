# Used by the ESP-IDF build system to store configuration options such as boot logging and partition table:
# At one point we were ignoring these files, but there is a lot of important stuff in them needed to get
# consistent builds across platforms.  For example: they have the instructions on not emmiting boot logs
# that can confuse the Elecraft KX radios, and they also have WiFi power level info which we lower to save
# battery and reduce WiFi noise into the radio HF bands.
